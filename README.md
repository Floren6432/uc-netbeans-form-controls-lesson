# uc-netbeans-form-controls-lesson

This is a Java Swing application created during my third year of university studies as part of a course exercise to practice GUI components and event handling in Java Swing. It demonstrates the use of common GUI form controls such as combo boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and file chooser dialogs. Users can select items from dropdowns, check multiple options, choose a single payment option, and open files with filters applied.

Instructions:
1. Just download the .zip file,
2. then open NetBeans, and follow these steps:
3. Go to File > Open Project
4. Navigate to the unzipped folder
5. Select the project folder (it should contain a nbproject folder)
6. Click Open Project

NetBeans will load the project and youâ€™re ready to build and run it.
